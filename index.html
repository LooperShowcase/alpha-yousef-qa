        The Toyota Supra (Japanese: トヨタ・スープラ, Hepburn: Toyota Sūpura) is
        a sports car and grand tourer manufactured by the Toyota Motor
        Corporation beginning in 1978. The name "supra" is derived from the
        Latin prefix, meaning "above", "to surpass" or "go beyond".[3] The
        initial four generations of the Supra were produced from 1978 to 2002.
        The fifth generation has been produced since March 2019 and went on sale
        in May 2019.[4] The styling of the original Supra was derived from the
        Toyota Celica, but it was both longer and wider.[5] Starting in
        mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a separate model from the Celica. In
        turn, Toyota also stopped using the prefix Celica and named the car
        Supra.[6] Owing to the similarity and past of the Celica's name, it is
        frequently mistaken for the Supra, and vice versa. The first, second and
        third generations of the Supra were assembled at the Tahara plant in
        Tahara, Aichi, while the fourth generation was assembled at the
        Motomachi plant in Toyota City. The 5th generation of the Supra is
        assembled alongside the G29 BMW Z4 in Graz, Austria by Magna Steyr.

      The Supra has a history of professional drag racing, mainly in Japan and
      the United States. The HKS team have used both the Mk III and Mk IV to
      showcase its products, known as the HKS Drag Supra. This Supra was driven
      by Charlie Goncalves Catanho. It was mainly built on a custom chassis with
      a carbon fiber body, the Mk III version housed a de-stroked 2.89-liter
      twin-turbo 7M-GTE, good for 600 kW (800 bhp) at over 9000 rpm, giving a
      best quarter mile time of 8.09 seconds.[1] The HKS Drag 70 Supra later set
      a 7-second 1⁄4 mi (402 m) in 1991.
